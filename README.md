## Final Conslusion

To improve the productivity, a strategic business plan focused on Employee retension should be implemented. Active feedback from the employees leaving the company should be given high priority. In addition to the profits of the company, employee wellness should also be considered to reduce the attrition rate and improve the Employee retension count.
